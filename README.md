# ðŸ“± Digital Communication  

## ðŸ“š Overview  
This repository contains implementations and analyses of various **digital communication techniques**, including **modulation, demodulation, and signal processing methods**. The project explores how audio signals are sampled, modulated, and reconstructed using techniques such as **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)** and **Delta Modulation**, along with **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis**.  

## ðŸ”¬ Key Topics Covered  
- **Sampling Theory**  
  - Nyquist Rate Sampling  
  - Under-Sampling (Aliasing)  
  - Over-Sampling  
- **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**  
  - PAM Modulation & Demodulation  
  - Signal Reconstruction with Low-Pass Filtering  
- **Delta Modulation**  
  - Delta Modulation & Demodulation  
  - Quantization Errors & Staircase Effect  
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Analysis**  
  - Evaluating signal quality after reconstruction

## ðŸ“Š Results & Analysis  
- PAM and Delta Modulation techniques are analyzed based on their **signal reconstruction quality**.  
- **SNR values** help quantify how well the original signal is reconstructed.  
- Delta Modulation is **data-efficient** but introduces **quantization noise**, while PAM is more **sensitive to noise**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion  
This project highlights the significance of **sampling and modulation** techniques in digital communication. The choice of modulation technique impacts **signal quality, bandwidth efficiency, and noise resistance**.
